# vTDS Layer Build Directory

This is the root of whatever build tree is needed to build vTDS
systems at this layer. Checked into source control, it should contain
nothing but the `.gitignore` file and this `README.md`. In use it will
contain sub-directories named for each vTDS system built, each of
which will contain whatever run-time data is needed on a per vTDS
system basis.
